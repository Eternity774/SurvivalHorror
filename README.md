# Survival horror game


This is my first project in Unity. I made it after learning Unity basics with **Joseph Hocking "Unity in basics"**. At that moment I really know just basics and didn't even know about NavMesh Agent and some other components. I really like horror games and decided to choose **Survival horror** as a project, when I can learn something new and have more practice.

This project is look like **Slender games**, that was the main idea. We have 1-st person character with flashlight in his hands, forest map with hills, trees and some reference points such as house, car, signs etc. Main idea of this game is to find 5 gasolin canisters and fill up our bike to runaway from **Crawler**.

On screenshot you can see game map, it's static and made with Unity terrain, and trees are made with **terrain tools**.

On next screenshots you can see reference points with canisters near it. 
Look at this sign **"You're going to DIEEE"**. This is scary, isn't it?  C:

Here is our **Crawler**

Scary, isn't it? When you play with lightning turned off and only flashlight can light your path, it looks more scary. 

Crawler just running very fast passing his checkpoints, and when he see player, his speed slows down and coming to hit player.

Here you can see his **path** (yellow line).
