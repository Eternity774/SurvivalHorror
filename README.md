# Survival horror game


This is my first project in Unity. I made it after learning Unity basics with **Joseph Hocking "Unity in basics"**. At that moment I new only basics and haven't even heard about NavMesh Agent and some other components. I really like horror games and that's why I chose **Survival horror** as a project, to learn something new and to get more practice.

This project is similar to **Slender games**, that was the main idea. There is 1-st person character with flashlight in his hands, forest map with hills, trees and some reference points such as house, car, signs etc. The main idea of this game is to find 5 gasoline canisters and to fill up your bike to run away from **Crawler**.

In the screenshot you can see game map, it's static and made with Unity terrain, and trees made with **terrain tools**.

In next screenshots you can see reference points with canisters near it. 
Look at this sign **"You're going to DIEEE"**. This is scary, isn't it?  C:

# Enemy
Here is our **Crawler**

Scary, isn't it? When you play with lightning turned off and only flashlight can light your path, it looks more scary. 

Crawler just running very fast passing his checkpoints, and when he see player, his speed slows down and coming to hit player.

Here you can see his **path** (yellow line).
